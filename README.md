# Online-Medical-System
We all know that technology is progressing every day, and that many aspects of our daily lives will be digitalized. The medical system around the world is one of the scenarios that has piqued my interest in working on it. Patients in wealthy countries have access to systems that are simple to use, yet they cannot simply access whatever health organisation desire. Furthermore, there are only a few international websites that provide information or counselling to patients in Afghanistan. Patients will find our online medical system to be simple, informative, and easy to use. Patients will be able to use and visit all of the legitimate medical facilities that they prefer. Aside from the patients, the Afghan government will have no trouble registering all doctors, hospitals, and medical stores that follow the norms and regulations.
